# PID-Stewart-Platform

This project was submitted as part of the ECE 120 Honor Lab during the Fall semester of 2018. Originally inspired by a PID 6 degree of freedom Stewart Platform built by Full Motions Dynamics (https://youtu.be/j4OmVLc_oDw) our team of 3 wanted to accomplish something similar. Our design utilized 6 servo motors attached to a rectangular wooden base holding a touch resistive panel that tracks the relative location of a marble from the center. The location is relayed to an arduino which controlled the servos to tilt in the direction that balances the marble in the center of the platform. For the reverse kinematic arduino code, we ultimately ran out of time trying to implement a PID system instead having to opt for a trigonometric approximation. This along with the arduino crystal not refreshing fast enough ultimately led to the servo tilt overcompensating for locations relatively far from the center of the platform which can be seen in the demo video. More details are included in the Proposal and Final report.
